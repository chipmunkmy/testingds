2,5,"The best blended coffee in this restaurant at KL East. I have been many starbucks restaurant in kuala lumpur. This is the best outlet prepared the coffee. Blended well with milk and everything. You could taste the thick of coffee that they prepared. Normally, i just order via GRAB during this MCO..And I will drive all the way to KL East to have the best Latte. Thank you so much for the owner of this restaurant and the staff."
3,5,"Spacious and cozy new @KL East Mall. Love this new outlet?s spacious and cozy setup, overwhelming response and it?s full house too, Good WiFi."
4,1,Just unreasonable. Bought 4 drinks(ice blended for RM76) requested for cup sleeves but was declined by the staff.cold ice blended drinks how do they expect us to hold?
5,3,Inattentive customer service. Forgot our food order which we found to be upsetting. I really expected a lot more and was very disappointed with the overall experience.
6,1,"Worst coffee, McDonald's next door better. I thought I would try Starbucks because it's been extremely hard to find a decent coffee. Well, it was terrible, the so called barista says, I put low fat milk, maybe he was implying that I am fat....I said, what did you do that for, he said tastes better, well guess what...it was disgusting....I complained, they gave me a new one with so much coffee and no milk, would've kept me awake for a week....the staff need serious training on how to make a coffee.
My suggestion....go to McDonald's next door, the coffee is much better and nearly half the price."
7,3,Not the best Starbucks. There's better Starbucks to be sure. Very limited food selection. Drinks are always similar at all Starbucks.
8,4,"Friendly staff. I went to Starbucks yesterday. I ate a cheese sandwich. It was not delicious or awful. The ice coffee was cold, awesome and good value. The cheese sandwich was quite expensive and the ice coffee was expensive. Starbucks is not good value. The price of a cheese sandwich was 12RM and the ice coffee was 16RM. The staff were always friendly, kind and polite. The service was good but slow because it was sometimes crowded."
9,4,Very good staff! The food at starbucks is always a rescue when traveling internationally. The friendly staff makes a lot of difference though. Had their homemade pasta with chicken meatballs and blueberry cheesecake.
10,4,Good service- good cup of coffee. Pleasant experience-- server friendly- visited 10 am-Wednesday. Good large cup of coffee-- just right= not too strong not weak.& HOT!!! Managers having meetings with staff-(tla) talk listen act== That's why-- the tables were not cleaned of trays. Opens up around 8:30-9:00 am-- late for me-- Was there 8 am==construction worker- we start 7 am. Other foods were offered( rolls/bread/croissant- but declined= want to wait for dinner - try not to get full.
11,5,"Vegetarian at Starbucks? Yes! Vegetarian Curry Puffs are available at Starbucks in Kuala Lumpur and they are delicious! I typically get some sort of bread or pastry with my Hot Americano, but I was so surprised to see they have local options like this. Great!"
12,4,Nice place. Inside u can relax with comfy chair and outside for smoking ....while your wife or girlfriend doing shopping... u can relax inside starbucks and charge ur phone or take a nap?
13,4,"What I like from Kuala Lumpur, even for the waitres or waitresses can speak English! Very good wifi, and good service. But please more smiling. That is very important."
14,4,Fast prompt service. Went to mid valley branch. Service fast and prompt. Friendly staff too. Tried the new yogurt Apricot and peach yogurt frappucino drink. It?s nice and not sweet. It has 3 layers. The bottom are peach jelly then top with tangy yogurt blend and topped with apricot sauce. Priced at rm17.50 and seriously not cheap though . Place at mid valley has been revamped and it?s not smoke free outside which is great. Great to sit out as it?s cosy at night
15,4,"KL trip 2018. As usual this is a good Starbucks coffee house , had a hot choclate and was satified with the product"
16,2,Starbucks - Where else when you need a cup of coffee with friends and with WIFI availability especially in the rainy day.
17,3,"Nothing different here. service slow, coffee generally the same as any Starbucks. Only go here if you cant do better as its nearly always the price setter and as with Starbucks worldwide, its average at best."
18,5,"All Time favorite ...Star Bucks is all time favorite .. so if i see a star bucks , i have to be there .. One Latte and a cake is always i have and had the same here .. Simply no difference from their other outlets globally .."
19,4,"Famous Outlet. This Starbucks is at the Menara Hup Seng Jalan P. Ramlee. Nice, clean environment at a prominent location. Delicious dishes of your choice. Friendly staff and good service"
20,3,"Starbucks - Suria KLCC 4TH FLOOR. It was raining outside and we decided to spend time at starbucks, first of all they write my name wrong (not good experience), its ok we move on and then there was no wifi with poor connection, though coffee was good and the friend had banana cake which was also good. they have sitting area outside the cafe and it was a good experience for us. This is located inside the SURIA KLCC petronas tower so dont worry if you want starbucks when you visit Petronas."
21,2,"I find starbucks. where ever I go. It was actually not bad, the place let u sit for a while, while you drink ur coffee... the staff is not very motivated.... but over all nice."
22,5,Amazing environment. I came to this starbucks after my presentation and i would like to make a special remarks here the staff that night was friendly to me and patiently communicate to me in English.
23,5,Brunch. We hadn't eaten breakfast so grabbed sausage rolls and a pretzel/popcorn frappe drink at 11am. Place is clean staff are polite. Can't get enough of Starbucks.
24,1,We visited the starbucks in petronas twin towers for a quick coffee and check few emails and it was very bad idea the internet is so complicated to connect and never worked they restated it so many times and you need file every thing from the beginning I think it might work if you stay all whole day trying The coffee was ok and the food as well but never again
25,3,Nice location to get out of the heat. A well located Starbucks in the city centre. A good place to get out of the heat and enjoy a drink in a cool environment.
26,3,"Bad coffee, good ambience. ALways go for their drinks other than coffee which ironic. Hot chocolate, tea options and when desprate ,well...a warm'iced mocha :P Staffs are a fun and cheerful lot..good thing they enjoy their work with all the demanding and impatient people waiting for their orders. Their chocolate muffins are good,outsourced from elsewhere."
27,3,"Lousy Starbucks. Ok, this Starbucks located just a side of Plaza Kotaraya. There have indoor and outdoor place for customer as what other Starbucks do. The lousy thing is open area will occupied by other stranger which not Starbucks customer. Quit dirty and I saw some beggars also sitting at the open area tables. This thing happened everyday but the management seem like not bother it."
28,4,Starbuck TTDI for business meet. I am not a coffee drinker. This location was chose because there were many corners of long table for group business discussion. Upstairs is quieter & has more table for 6 to 8 pax. My favourite brekkie is always toast Cranberry chicken sandwich.
29,4,Very good food and ambience. The place is just in the heart of the city with excellent service and ambiance. Food was also fantastic.
